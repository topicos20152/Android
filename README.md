# Android
This repository contains the source code for the SIGAA Task List Android app.

## 1. Getting started:
The [Android SDK][1] is necessary to build the app. There are different options to install it in your system, depending of the IDE you decide to use. Check Google documentation about [installation][2] for more details on these options.

[Android Studio][3] is currently the official Android IDE. Due to this, we recommend it as the IDE to use in your development environment. Follow the installation instructions [here][4].

We recommend to use the last version available in the stable channel of Android Studio updates. See what update channel is your Android Studio checking for updates in the menu path 'Help'/'Check for Update...'/link 'Updates' in the dialog.

To set up the project in Android Studio follow the next steps:

* Clone the project from GitHub: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/topicos20152/Android.git
   ```
* Open Android Studio and select 'Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)'. Browse through your file system to the folder 'android' where the project is located. Android Studio will then create the '.iml' files it needs. If you ever close the project but the files are still there, you just select 'Open Project...'. The file chooser will show an Android face as the folder icon, which you can select to reopen the project.
* Android Studio will try to build the project directly after importing it. To build it manually, follow the menu path 'Build'/'Make Project', or just click the 'Play' button in the tool bar to build and run it in a mobile device or an emulator. The resulting APK file will be saved in the 'build/outputs/apk/' subdirectory in the project folder.
